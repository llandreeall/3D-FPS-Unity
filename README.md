# 3D-FPS-Unity
This is a 3D First Person Shooter Minigame made using Unity Game Engine. 
Movement is made using: WASD and space to jump. A user has available two weapons: a fast shooting gun and a shotgun, each having its own set of ammo. The weapons can be changed using the mouse wheel.
Using left-click you can shoot consuming ammo. If no ammo is left, press R to reload. You can reload as long as you have spare ammo left.
To pick-up ammo near, press Q on the keyboard.
Enemies are mindless and will roam free around the map, but if you get too close then they will follow you. They do not attack the user, only follows them. But the user can shoot them until their life bar drops to 0.
